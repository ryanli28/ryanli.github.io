        Hi! I'm Ryan. I'm studying symbolic systems and computer science at Stanford. I'm particularly <br>
        interested in artificial intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, venture capital, and philosophy, <br>
        and recently, I've also become curious in environmental and space technology, XR, and the effective <br>
        altruism movement. Some of my hobbies include photography, cooking, reading, and playing tennis. <br>
        I'd love to talk with you if you're interested in these things (or just cause) :) <br>
      </p>
